#Logical Operators  :{a+b} or means + || {a.b} and means *  || {a'}: not works on single variable
a=True
b=False
print(a and b) #result: False since 1*0 = 0 (False)
print(a or b) #result: True since 1+0=1 (True)
print(not a) # result: false

c=5 
d=5
print( c and d) # result: 5 since 1.1=1  (higher value is 1 and lower value is 0)
