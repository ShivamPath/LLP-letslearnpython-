#Typecasting : Helps in changing the variable type provided that variable type is valid.
# "31" is string literal and 31 is numeric literal


a="520"
a=int(a) # changed from str to int

print(a+4)

b= 55
b= str(b) #changed from int to str

print(" fifty five in numbers is " +b) 

c=65
c=float(c) #changed from int to float

print(c)
